asm-dom is a low-level virtual DOM library. It is unopinionated with regards to how you should structure your application.

You can take a look to [this](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom#structuring-applications) list in snabbdom repository, a js virtual DOM that inspire this library. Snabbdom has javascript APIs but you can still take inspiration from it and translate structures in C++.
